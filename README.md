### Ensuring ATS Compatibility

Many companies use **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** to filter resumes. These systems scan resumes for keywords, format, and structure to determine if a candidate matches a job posting. Here are some tips to ensure your resume passes ATS screening:

- **Use standard fonts:** Stick to basic fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.
- **Avoid images, graphics, and special characters:** ATS may not read these correctly, which could lead to your resume being rejected.
- **Stick to basic formatting:** Use simple headings, bullet points, and clear section titles. Avoid tables or text boxes.
- **Include relevant keywords:** Match keywords from the job description to increase the chances of your resume being selected.
- **Save your resume as `.docx` or `.pdf`:** While `.pdf` is widely accepted, some ATS may have trouble reading it, so `.docx` is often safer.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your resume not only impresses human recruiters but also passes through ATS software effectively.

## Tips for Writing a Great Resume

- **Be concise:** Keep bullet points short and focus on achievements rather than duties.
- **Tailor your resume:** Adjust your resume for each application to highlight relevant skills and experiences.
- **Use action verbs:** Start bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., "Developed," "Led," "Implemented").
- **Proofread:** Double-check for spelling and grammatical errors before submitting your resume.
